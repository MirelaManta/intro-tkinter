## Intro Tkinter ##  
Here, I learned the foundations of tkinter, such as:
* how to create an window and configure it
* the most common widgets(label, button, entry, text) and some of their methods
* how to give a button functionality
* when and how to use layout managers (pack(), grid() and place())
* concepts of *args and **kwargs
